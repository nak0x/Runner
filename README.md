Then open the project with Unity.

## What this game is about

So, as I am a fan of simplistic 3D art style with only white mate surface, a colored fog and simple shapes,
I decide to create a game in that style.
In this game you will start as a simple cube, lost in the shades. Your goal: find your way to the light.
To do so, you will need to gathers items & materials, craft some tools & survive.
Oh and I forgot to mention that you need light to survive. Without light, your body slowly loose energy,
and when your Iradiance fall to 0, you return to the state of rock. A useless as you have always be.
To make sure to find the light, and also to keep energy, you will need to be creative, as the more you find,
the harder it get's. Will you made your way throw the shades ?
